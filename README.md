# Challenge 01 NU-VIRT-FSF-PT-01-U-LOLC

## Description

This is the first challenge from my coding bootcamp, consisting of simple code refactoring with html and CSS. div elements were replaced with semantic tags and alt attributes were added respectively to ensure accessibility.

On the CSS side, div classes were removed as redundant and appropriate semantic elements were targeted in their stead.
